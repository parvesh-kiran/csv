2,"Agent Jessica: Hello! This is Jessica from TechWorld customer service. How may I assist you? | Customer: Hi, my wireless earbuds aren't connecting to my phone properly | Agent Jessica: I'm sorry to hear that! Let's troubleshoot this together. What type of phone are you using and what's the model of the earbuds? | Customer: iPhone 14 and TechWorld Pro Buds | Agent Jessica: Perfect! First, let's try resetting the earbuds. Put them in the case, hold the button for 10 seconds until the light flashes red. | Customer: Okay done, the light flashed red | Agent Jessica: Great! Now on your iPhone, go to Settings > Bluetooth and forget the TechWorld Pro Buds if they're listed there. | Customer: Found them and removed them | Agent Jessica: Now take the earbuds out of the case - they should be in pairing mode with a flashing blue light. Try connecting from your Bluetooth settings. | Customer: Yes! They're connecting now. The sound is working perfectly | Agent Jessica: Wonderful! The reset fixed the connection issue.
